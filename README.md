The Online Library Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to help institutions streamline the management of their library resources. It provides a homepage that showcases the library and a unified login and registration system, where students verify their accounts via a Gmail OTP system, and admins go through a request-approval process for enhanced security.

Key Features:
For Students:

Book Request System: Allows students to request books conveniently.
Issue and Return Management: Tracks issued books, returns, and any applicable fines.
Chat System: Facilitates communication with admins in a chat format, similar to WhatsApp.
Feedback Page: A dedicated section for students to provide feedback on their library experience.
For Admins:

Book Management: Add, delete, approve, and track book returns.
Request Approval: Review and approve admin registration requests to ensure secure access.
Messaging System: Communicate with students directly through a chat system.
This system centralizes key operations, making it easy for both students and admins to manage their library interactions effectively and securely.
